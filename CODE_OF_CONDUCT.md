## Special Provisions for Medical Research

Given the nature of this project, we have additional standards specific to medical research:

### Data Ethics:

* **Patient Privacy First:** All data must be fully anonymized
* **Informed Consent:** Only share data with proper consent
* **IRB Compliance:** Provide ethics approval for all contributions
* **No Harm:** Never use data in ways that could harm patients

### Scientific Integrity:

* **Honest Reporting:** Report both positive and negative results
* **No P-Hacking:** Don't manipulate data to achieve desired outcomes
* **Transparent Methods:** Document all methodologies clearly
* **Reproducibility:** Share code and data when possible
* **Proper Citation:** Always credit original sources

### Clinical Responsibility:

* **Not Medical Advice:** This tool aids diagnosis but doesn't replace clinical judgment
* **Report Concerns:** If you notice dangerous predictions, report immediately
* **Patient Safety:** Clinical deployment must follow local regulations

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories
- Discussion forums
- Email communications
- Virtual meetings
- Conferences and workshops
- Social media channels

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

üìß **conduct@mycetoma-kg.org**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

For sensitive issues, you may also contact individual moderators:
- [Moderator 1 Name]: moderator1@mycetoma-kg.org
- [Moderator 2 Name]: moderator2@mycetoma-kg.org

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

### Special Cases: Data Violations

**Patient Data Breach:** Immediate permanent ban + legal reporting if required
**Data Fabrication:** Permanent ban + retraction of contributions
**Plagiarism:** Warning (first offense) ‚Üí Permanent ban (repeat)

## Appeals Process
